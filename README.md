## Dependencies

You need [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv). The easiest way to install it is to get `pip`
and run `pip install --user pipenv`. If you get `pipenv: command not found` you might need to
log out and in again.

## Setup and Commands

Before starting, download all files from `Kulturkrock/Projekt/Skärmkrock/Utvecklingsdata` on
the Drive and put them under `resources`.

The following commands are available:

| Command                     | Effect                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `make`                      | Run both `init` and `dev`                                          |
| <code>make&nbsp;init</code> | Install dependencies                                               |
| <code>make&nbsp;dev</code>  | Run Core in development mode, with automatic reload on file change |

## Environment variables

You can configure Core with the following environment variables:

| Variable                  | Effect                                          |
